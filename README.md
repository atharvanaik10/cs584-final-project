# Introduction
This code serves as an experimentation ground for implementing the [simplex-verify](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JXREUkyHi7u) algorithm into alpha-beta CROWN. The simplex-verify folder is forked from [this repository](https://github.com/harkiratbehl/simplex-verify)

# Running the code
The code can be run as follows. 

Make sure you are in the `simple-crown` folder. You can then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements. Code can then be run using `python crown.py data1.pth`

For running `simplex-verify`, you can check out the readme in their repository.
